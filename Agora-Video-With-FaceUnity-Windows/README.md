## Running the Sample Program

1. Create a developer account at [Agora.io] (https://dashboard.agora.io/cn/signup/).
2. Create your own test project and obtain an App ID.
   
   NOTE: For more information, see [Obtaining an App ID](https://docs.agora.io/en/2.2/addons/Signaling/Agora%20Basics/key_signaling?platform=All%20Platforms). 
   
3. Modify the configuration file *AgoraFaceUnity.ini*.

         [LoginInfo]

          AppId=//Your App ID
 
          ChannelName= //ChannelName

          LoginUid= //Uid

          VideoSolutinIndex= //VideoSolutinoIndex default 40

4. Use Visual Studio 2013 to open Agora-FaceUnity-Tutorial-Windows.sln. 

**Note:**

 The default capturing parameter is 640x480, so the corresponding VideoSolutionIndex should be 40. If the camera does not support a resolution of 640x480, you need to change the capturing resolution and change the VideoSolutionIndex accordingly.
